# CWT-Java
A java library for handling CBOR Web Tokens.

This is a small library for CWTs. It uses COSE-Java (by Jim Schaad) and CBOR-Java (by Peter Occil).

Caution: This library is no longer maintained, since it is now part of [ACE-Java](https://bitbucket.org/marco-tiloca-sics/ace-java). Please
check there for an up to date version of this library.
