# CWT-Java
A java library for handling CBOR Web Tokens.

This is a small library for CWTs. It uses COSE-Java (by Jim Schaad) and CBOR-Java (by Peter Occil).

This is intended to become a larger library for ACE (https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/ace/), but I thought it might be useful 
on it's own.
